# Coinbase Clone
This Project was created for the subject of Mobile Development at IFSP-BRA, the objective is to implement some concepts learned at the classes, all groups got random designs to implement, ours was the Coinbase with major changes to the original one.

# About the folder structure architecture
I know the way i did it is ugly, it is this way only to be more didactic when i'm presenting this in front of the class, and since the idea was only to organize the project and not implement a real architecture pattern on the project i've decided to do it this way.
